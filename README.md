### Pewlett-Hackard Employee Database SQL Challenge

  I had a hard time getting the QuickDBD website to work for me (continued to go through a loop of the errors "Invalid table name (use double quotes)" and "Unrecognized table metadata") and ended up using Postgres' Create ERD funtion to get my ERD .png file. The zoom on it makes it a bit hard to see, but the associations were correct. After making my schema and importing my CSV files to the corresponding tables, I began querying the 8 data analysis questions. I created my .sql files using VSCode and had everything ready in it's appropriate folders, but I somehow ran into a critical error when trying to push everything to GitHub deleting all source data files and completed code files. In trying to recreate everything, I somehow created and uploaded .txt files when they were supposed to be .sql files. The files still contain the same contents, so I hope this won't be as big of an issue as I originally feared it would be. The output files are seperated by Data Modeling (PH_employee_db_ERD.png), Data Engineering (employee_db_creation.txt), and Data Analysis (employee_data_analysis.txt). All code written by myself with the help of Xpert Learning Assistant and ChatGPT.
